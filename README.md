## Front-end

Step 1:    
Install npm and yarn package manager.
Details of the installation can be found in the [installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
After installation, you can run the following command to install the dependencies in /root/frontend folder.
```sh
> yarn -v

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.50.3:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.

## Back-end
We use python 3.8 as the backend language. So before you start to use the backend, you need to ensure the python version of your computer is 3.8. You can check the version of your computer by running the following command.
```sh
> python3 --version
```
Step 1: Install the dependencies.   
In the backend folder, you can run the following command to install the dependencies. Depending on the pip version, you may try with pip3 or pip for the below commands.
```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 2: Run the application.
Run the command below to start the app in backend folder:
```sh
$ python3 app.py
```
4) The server shoud be able to run on local server when you see the following information in the terminal.
```sh
